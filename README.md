# django-blog

This is just a random project for me to play around with Django and Bootstrap. I'm learning these technologies to get better at web development :) If you want to see what the project is like, here's how to start the project:


Clone the Repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/samuelwongsy/django-blog.git
cd django-blog
```
Make migrations to set up a local database:
```
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py makemigrations blog
python3 manage.py migrate
```
Create a User using Django's command:
```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
Finally, run the server:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
I'll be using this to test different Bootstrap functionality and try to improve on my CSS styling! More to come~
